  # Rerunner manages reruns of past failures
  # because individual failures are rerun
  # indpependently there are problems that
  # need to be addressed
  #
  # 1. rspec is always going to start the numbering at 1
  #    (for every run) so we end up with 1, 1, 1, 1...
  # 2. a failure might become fixed and need to be
  #    removed from the list
  # 3. a single failure might become multiple failures
  #    which then need to be recorded.
  #
  # In order to accomplish 2 we need to create
  # a new "past run"  object that we can populate with
